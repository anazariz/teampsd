## Key Idea

## Data Dialogue 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651873_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

Collaboratively learn about interactive data exploration, seeing and visualizing data, and dialoguing about data within the team.

      
## Mental Model

People may have mental models that data is difficult to understand or work with. Or even worse, people may have experiences when data was used by leadership or administrators to “punish” staff based on them not meeting artificially set goals that are not feasible within system structure.

## PSD Process

We will familiarize ourselves with clinic and patient data that is available, understand the dynamic relationships contributing to EBP reach, and grow increasingly comfortable with using the data to engage in the PSD process.

## Data Visualization

Describe, examine, and interact with key clinic and patient variables 

## Purpose of the Session: Become Familiar with our data

## Learning Loop Exercise

An example of visualizing data that many of us may relate to is looking at a credit score simulator: https://www.creditkarma.com/tools/credit-score-simulator
Here, we see that we can ask the question, “What Might Happen If I …” For example … Get a new loan  check out what happens to your score?  Or, “Close my oldest card  check out what happens with the score. In the same way that we want to develop familiarity with these 5 variables for a credit score, we will understand the different variables that are collected e.g., clinic variables: clinic scheduling, including availability, scheduled appointments, completed appointments, no-shows, and missed opportunities; patient variables: progress in initiating and completing evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for PTSD, Depression, AUD, and OUD, in order to examine how they contribute to EBP reach

## Synthesis

Data does not have to be scary. There are different ways to use data early and often that will help us make decisions that will improve patient care
