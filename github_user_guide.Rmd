# GitHub User Guide  
### **Creating An Account**  
Create an account if you have not already done so. When creating an account, make a username that doesn't use any spaces, special characters, capital letters, etc.  Just use lowercase letters and underscores if necessary. This is good coding style.  

### **Basics of GitHub**  
Go through the quick guide in the link below. It will teach you how about repositories, branches, commits, and opening/merging pull requests.

### **Creating Files**  
For syntax and style guidelines, refer to r_markdown_cheatsheet.pdf, which you can find in this branch. Again, name files in all lowercase with underscores as needed. You can also refer to other files in the repository for assistance. To view the file's code, simply click "Raw" in the top right corner of the file, next to "Blame" and "History."  
*Please do not create files in the master branch*

### **Uploading Files**  
To upload files, simply choose the branch that you want to upload to and upload the file. The file will be named as it was in your computer, so make sure to give the file a name that is simple and reflective of its contents to anyone that reads the file name.  
*Please do not upload files to the master branch*

### **Downloading Files**  
Files cannot be downloaded individually - you have to download the entire branch.  You can find the green "Download" button on the main page of each branch.

### **GitHub Workflow**
1. Open up the specific file you want to edit.  Create a new working branch and name it using all lowercase, no spaces (use underscores), and your initials - i.e. "facilitation_guide_sp".

2. Make sure you're in the branch you just created instead of the original branch.  Click the pencil icon to edit.  Edit the file and add comments on changes you made.  Click on "Commit".

3. Go to "Pull Requests" and click on "New Pull Request". The "Base" branch should be the original branch (most likely "master").  The "Compare" branch will be the branch you created. Click on "Create a New Pull Request".  Add "Reviewers" and click on "TeamPSD" for the "Project section. Click on "Create Pull Request".

4. To add line specific comments, click on "Files Changed".  Hover your mouse in front of the specific line in question and a blue plus sign will appear.  Click on that and add your comment.
