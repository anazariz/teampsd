# Welcome to *MTL*

*MTL* was co-developed by patient, provider and program officers over the last 5 years. *MTL* is a national quality improvement initiative in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). 

In our upcoming first session of *MTL* we're modeling to learn how to align our team vision.

Dr. Matt Moore will be your facilitator  for the duration of the 12 session plan of  MTL.  Matt Moore, PhD, is a Clinical Psychologist who has spent his career in a variety of clinical and administrative positions at VA. He earned his PhD from The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. From his early days at VA working in the clinical front-lines, his focus has consistently been on improving mental health care for Veterans. He took on a variety of roles in support of that desire by advancing to the management of VA outpatient clinics and overseeing facility wide mental health services. In 2015, he moved into his current position at VACO in the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention as a National Mental Health Technical Assistance Specialist. Living in San Francisco affords him the opportunity to explore adventurous dining and wine tasting opportunities. He also never turns down the opportunity to travel.

Meet Tammy Thompson, US Air Force Veteran and member of VAPOR (Veterans Advisory Partnership for Operations and Research) alumni with TeamPSD. During her time with the team as a member of VAPOR, she ensured that Veterans' voices were represented at the stakeholder table. As a veteran of the U.S. Air Force having served for 8 years, she welcomes the opportunity to give back. She is a “Certified Peer Support Specialist” as well as an Advanced Level WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) Facilitator working at the VA hospital in Menlo Park where she has the opportunity to co-facilitate with another Advanced Level WRAP facilitator. Having had her own struggles with many different issues and after searching for a better way she was introduced to WRAP. During some of her more challenging lived experiences it was by “grace” and by utilizing her WRAP that she was able to quickly recover and go on with the business of living. At present, she runs a 12 week WRAP group in the Veterans Recovery Center in San Jose, CA. She constantly remind myself and others that Wellness is Possible.
