## TeamPSD Difference Between Issue or Feature Cards
- [ ] Orient to [**MTL.how/teampsd**](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd)  on your internet browser
- [ ] In the panel select the **Issues** tab
- [ ] Select the **New Issue** green square on the right hand side
- [ ] Decide on the choice of ticket you want to create **Feature** or **Issue** 
- [ ] Use case for **Issue** cards are when you have a **task** that you have been asked to do, or a **Bug** that needs squashing
- [ ] Use case for a **Feature** is when you are working on developing a new tool or capability.
- [ ] Select the **green button** with the label **get started** for either **feature** or **issue**. 
- [ ] Follow the steps for the different type of card outlined below.

## Issue Card
- [ ] The **issue** card includes a **guide** and **list of action items** for you to complete to ensure that the content of the card is as useful and self-explanatory as possible.
- [ ] The [template](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.md) includes **Title & Due Date**, suggestions to add **screenshots** and a **9 click** step on assigning the issue.
- [ ] Cards using this template will go through either the [bug tracker](https://mtl.how/bugs) or be associated with each of the workgroups using the **labels** tab
- [ ] Decide if your **issue card** is a **Bug** or a **Task** and change the title to reflect this.
- [ ] Add a brief **description** that will enable others to **orient** themselves to the overall content of the **issue** .
- [ ] The **9 clicks** refer to allocation of the **issue card** within the [TeamPSD work space](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/board?assignees=ritahitching&filterLogic=any&repos=87591711) - options within each **section** can be seen by **pulling down on the arrow** by the **section label**. 
- [ ] Assign you **issue card** to the appropriate **pipeline** - to prioritize the content of the **task card** or **bug card**
- [ ] All **urgent issues** including **bugs** should be assigned to the **Priority Epic**.
- [ ] Other **task cards** should be allocated to the appropriate **pipeline** which includes **Priority Epic** (current focus of work), **Upcoming Epic** (work that will need to be completed by the next epic) and **Upcoming Backlog** (work that will need to be completed two epics back from the current epic) and **Icebox** (work that will need to be completed but does not currently have an associated due date)
- [ ] Select the appropriate **Assignee** this will typically be you or an individual team member producing work for the issue.  Typically, only **1** person is assigned to a task card.
- [ ] Select an **label** for your issue card - typically the choice of label is associated with the **workgroup lead** for which the task card is associated with - they are responsible for tracking and completing the task.  
- [ ] In TeamPSD **projects** refer to the **TeamPSD trackers** ([issues](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/issues), [bugs](http://mtl.how/bugs), [features](http://mtl.how/features), [document](http://mtl.how/documents), [manuscript](http://mtl.how/manuscript), and [team](http://mtl.how/team)).  Select the **Projects** your issue card is associate with. **Note** that **not all** issue cards need to be associated with a **project** with the **exception** of **bugs** which always need to be associated with the [bug tracker](http://mtl.how/bugs)
- [ ] The allocation of an issue ticket to a **Milestones** is topically consistent with the **date** of the corresponding **epic**.  Dates for TeamPSD milestones can be found on [ZenHUb](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/milestones)
- [ ] Anticipate the amount of **points/effort** that a task is likely to require and based on the **scope** of work. The general recommendation is to **over estimate** the amount of points and **adjust** if needed.  
- [ ] As part of the TeamPSD master plan project **epics** are created to enable the team to focus their efforts appropriately.  Each issue card needs to be associated with an **epic** , if you need additional information on choice of **epic** details of TeamPSD [epics](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/roadmap) may be helpful.
- [ ]  An additional part of the TeamPSD master plan project is **releases** typically associated with the release of a *MTL* version or in response to a grant or particular project ([MT_1.7](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/tree/master/release_1.7), MTL_2.0](https://github.com/lzim/mtl) and [MTL_covid19].  **Note** that **not all** issue cards need to be associated with a **release**.
- [ ] The final step to creating an issue card is **select the green** button **Submit new issue** 
- [ ] If you anticipate that your **issue card** or **bug card** will have **dependencies** these can be added once the issue has been submitted. 
- [ ] Within the issue you've created look for the **grey button** labelled **add dependency** - assess if your issue is **blocking** or **blocked** by another issue card and **tag** the relevant issue by **searching** for the issue by **name** or issue **number**.
- [ ] Issue cards can be both **blocking** and **blocked** by simultaneously. 


 # Features Card
- [ ] The **features** card includes a **guide** and **list of action items** for you to complete to ensure that the content of the card is as useful and self-explanatory as possible.
- [ ] The [template](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md) includes a **7 step** process to document the **feature requirements** that includes **define** (work breakdown), **design** (operations to do & research to do), **develop** (in-development or frozen), **test** (bring tested), **prod** (in production) and **done**.
- [ ] Each **section** of the template has **associated task cards** (other work to develop the feature). 
- [ ] The purpose of the [template](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md)  is to ensure that **requirements** are **checked off** and to verify the **progress** of the feature through the [feature tracker](http://mtl.how/features).
- [ ] Ensure that the **define in work breakdown** is described in **sufficiently detailed** that the developers have a **clear guidance** on the **specifications** of the **feature**.
- [ ] The **work breakdown** needs to include the **what & why** of the **feature** and appropriate allocation of **date & who**.
- [ ] Document and cross reference the commensurate **issue cards** for the **define in work breakdown** section.
- [ ] In the **design** section address the **operations to do** and the **research to do** in **sufficiently detailed** that the developers have a **clear guidance**
- [ ] The **design** needs to incorporate the **what & why of the MVP of design** of the **feature** and appropriate allocation of **date & who**.
- [ ] Document and cross reference the commensurate **issue cards** for the **design - operations and research to do** section.
- [ ] In the **develop** section address the **stage** of the development process the **feature** is in (under development, frozen)
- [ ] Document and cross reference the commensurate **issue cards** for the **develop stage** section.
- [ ] At the **test** section consider the **functional tests** that the **feature** will require such as a **testing checklist** or a **master feature card.**
- [ ] The **test** section needs to include the **what & why** of the **feature** and needed updates to relevant **documentation** (e.g. guides) and need to be tracked in the [document tracker](http://mtl.how/document).
- [ ] The **test** phase of **feature** needs to include allocation of appropriate **date & who** will be responsible for the **testing**.
- [ ] Document and cross reference the commensurate **issue cards** for the **test stage**.
- [ ] The **prod** phase is the last stage of **feature** development and includes the **what & why of feature** and the allocation and delegation of **date & who** will be responsible for the **release** of the **feature**.
- [ ] Relevant **work groups** need to be alerted to any changes to the **features** and includes the **describe learners**, **detail facilitators**,**document team**, **disseminate scientists VA** and **depend products**.
- [ ] Document and cross reference the commensurate **issue cards** for the **prod phase**.
- [ ] The final step in a new **feature** cycle is the **closed** stage.  At this stage a **new feature** is fully documented, users are trained and ready for the next release.
