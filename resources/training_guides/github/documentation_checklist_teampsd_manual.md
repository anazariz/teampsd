## TeamPSD Difference Between Issue or Feature Cards
- [ ] Orient to [**MTL.how/teampsd**](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd)  on your internet browser
- [ ] In the panel select the **Issues** tab
- [ ] Select the **New Issue** green square on the right hand side
- [ ] Decide on the choice of ticket you want to create **Feature** or **Issue** 
- [ ] Use case for **Issue** cards is when you have a **task** that you have been asked to do, or a **Bug** that needs squashing
- [ ] Use case for a **Feature** is when you are working on developing a new tool or capability.
- [ ] Follow the steps for the different type of card below

## Issue Card
- [ ] The **issue** card includes a **guide** and **list of action items** for you to complete to ensure that the content of the card is as useful and self-explanatory as possible.
- [ ] The [template](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.md) includes **Title & Due Date**, suggestions to add **screenshots** and a **9 click** step on assigning the issue.
- [ ] Cards using this template will go through either the [bug_tracker](https://mtl.how/bugs) or be associated with each of the workgroups using the **labels** tabe
- [ ] Decide if your **issue card** is a **Bug** or a **Task** and change the title to reflect this.
- [ ] Add a brief **description** that will enable others to **orient** themselves to the overall content of the **issue** .
- [ ] The **9 clicks** refer to allocation of the **issue card** within the [TeamPSD work space](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/board?assignees=ritahitching&filterLogic=any&repos=87591711) - options within each **section** can be seen by **pulling down on the arrow** by the **section label**. 
- [ ] Assign you **issue card** to the appropriate **pipeline** - to prioritize the content of the **task card** or **bug card**
- [ ] All **urgent issues** including **bugs** should be assigned to the **Priority Epic**.
- [ ] Other **task cards** should be allocated to the appropriate **pipeline** which includes **Priority Epic** (current focus of work), **Upcoming Epic** (work that will need to be completed by the next epic) and **Upcoming Backlog** (work that will need to be completed two epics back from the curren epic) and **Icebox** (work that will need to be completed but does not currently have an associated due date)
- [ ] Select the appropriate **Assignee** this will typically be you or an individual team member producing work for the issue.  Typically only **1** person is assigned to a task card.
- [ ] Select an **label** for your issue card - typically the choice of label is associated with the **workgroup lead** for which the task card is associated with - they are responsible for tracking and completing the task.  
- [ ] In TeamPSD **projects** refer to the **TeamPSD trackers** ([issues](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/issues), [bugs](http://mtl.how/bugs), [features](http://mtl.how/features), [document](http://mtl.how/documents), [manuscript](http://mtl.how/manuscript), and [team](http://mtl.how/team)).  Select the **Projects** your issue card is associate with. **Note** that **not all** issue cards need to be associated with a **project** with the **exception** of **bugs** which always need to be associated with the [bug tracker](http://mtl.how/bugs)
- [ ] The alloaction of an issue ticket to a **Milestones** is tpically consistent with the **date** of the corresponding **epic**.  Dates for TeamPSD milestones can be found on [ZenHUb](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/milestones)
- [ ] Anticipate the amont of **points/effort** that a task is likely to require and based on the **scope** of work. The general recommendation is to **over estimate** the amount of points and **adjust** if needed.  
- [ ] As part of the TeamPSD master plan project **epics** are created to enable the team to focus their efforts appropriately.  Each issue card needs to be associated with an **epic** , if you need additional information on choice of **epic** details of TeamPSD [epics](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-psd-workspace-5e4ac9bd8d388dfba6d9aef5/roadmap) may be helpful.
- [ ]  An additional part of the TeamPSD master plan project is **releases** typically associated with the release of a *MTL* version or in response to a grant or particular project ([MT_1.7](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/tree/master/release_1.7), MTL_2.0](https://github.com/lzim/mtl) and [MTL_covid19].  **Note** that **not all** issue cards need to be associated with a **release**.
